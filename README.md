Rewrite code of Simplex in C AUTHOR: GPL(C) moshahmed/at/gmail. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3956950/c-c-implementation-of-simplex-method) in js. Add solution of minimization problem

##### Eigen 

Problems with eigenvectors. Solution can be incorrect

##### Ode 

Use Math.cos, Math.sin, Math.abs and etc for function call

##### Roots

For not polynomial use Math.cos, Math.sin, Math.abs and etc for function call and left and right bound must have different signs

##### Diff
